<!-- Some information about RAM -->
        <b>Random-access memory  <i>(RAM /r√¶m/)</i></b>is a form of 
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_memory" target="_blank">computer memory</a>  that can be read and changed in any order, typically used to store working data and machine code.[1][2] A random-access memory device allows
        data items to be read or written in almost the same amount of time irrespective of the 
        physical location of data inside the memory. In contrast, with other direct-access data
        storage media such as hard disks, CD-RWs, DVD-RWs and the older magnetic tapes and drum memory, the time required to read and write data items varies significantly depending on their physical locations on the recording medium, due to mechanical limitations such as media rotation speeds and arm movement.

        <a id="ram">RAM</a> 
        contains multiplexing and demultiplexing circuitry, to connect the
        data lines to the addressed storage for reading or writing the entry. Usually more than
        one bit of storage is accessed by the same address, and RAM devices often have multiple
        data lines and are said to be "8-bit" or "16-bit", etc. devices.

        In today's technology, random-access memory takes the form of integrated circuits (ICs).
        RAM is normally associated with volatile types of memory (such as DRAM modules), where
        stored information is lost if power is removed, although non-volatile RAM has also been
        developed.[3] Other types of non-volatile memories exist that allow random access
        for read operations, but either do not allow write operations or have other kinds of
        limitations on them. These include most types of ROM and a type of flash memory called
        NOR-Flash.

        The two main types of volatile random-access semiconductor memory are static random-access
        memory (SRAM) and dynamic random-access memory (DRAM). Commercial uses of semiconductor RAM
        date back to 1965, when IBM introduced the SP95 SRAM chip for their System/360 Model 95
        computer, and Toshiba used DRAM memory cells for its Toscal BC-1411 electronic calculator,
        both based on bipolar transistors. Commercial MOS memory, based on MOSFETs (MOS transistors),
        followed in the late 1960s. The first commercial DRAM IC chip was the Intel 1103, introduced 
        in October 1970. Synchronous dynamic random-access memory (SDRAM) later debuted with the 
        Samsung KM48SL2000 chip in 1992.

    <hr>
         <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_computing_hardware" target="_blank">Early computers</a> Early computers used relays, mechanical counters[4] or delay lines for main memory 
        functions. Ultrasonic delay lines could only reproduce data in the order it was written.
        Drum memory could be expanded at relatively low cost but efficient retrieval of memory 
        items required knowledge of the physical layout of the drum to optimize speed. 
        Latches built out of vacuum tube triodes, and later, out of discrete transistors, were 
        used for smaller and faster memories such as registers. Such registers were relatively 
        large and too costly to use for large amounts of data; generally only a few dozen or few 
        hundred bits of such memory could be provided.

        The first practical form of random-access memory was the Williams tube starting in 1947. It 
        stored data as electrically charged spots on the face of a cathode ray tube. Since the 
        electron beam of the CRT could read and write the spots on the tube in any order, memory 
        was random access. The capacity of the Williams tube was a few hundred to around a 
        thousand bits, but it was much smaller, faster, and more power-efficient than using 
        individual vacuprogram on 21 June 1948.[5] In fact, rather than the Williams tube memory 
        being designed for the Baby, the Baby was a testbed to demonstrate the reliability of 
        the memory.[6][7]

        The two widely used forms of modern RAM are static RAM <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_random-access_memory">(SRAM)</a>  and dynamic RAM 
        (DRAM). In SRAM, a bit of data is stored using the state of a six-transistor 
        memory cell. This form of RAM is more expensive to produce, but is generally 
        faster and requires less dynamic power than DRAM. In modern computers, SRAM is 
        often used as cache memory for the CPU. DRAM stores a bit of data using a 
        transistor and capacitor pair, which together comprise a DRAM cell. The capacitor 
        holds a high or low charge (1 or 0, respectively), and the transistor acts as a 
        switch that lets the control circuitry on the chip read the capacitor's state of 
        charge or change it. As this form of memory is less expensive to produce than 
        static RAM, it is the predominant form of computer memory used in modern computers.

    <hr>
        The memory cell is the fundamental building block of computer memory. The memory 
        cell is an electronic circuit that stores one bit of binary information and it must 
        be set to store a logic 1 (high voltage level) and reset to store a logic 0 (low 
        voltage level). Its value is maintained/stored until it is changed by the set/reset 
        process. The value in the memory cell can be accessed by reading it.

        In SRAM, the memory cell is a type of flip-flop circuit, usually implemented using 
        FETs. This means that SRAM requires very low power when not being accessed, but it 
        is expensive and has low storage density.
